# Function HTTP server

## Simple HTTP server

The fastest way to start a HTTP server is to use the `startHTTPServer` function.
The function takes two arguments; the first argument is the options, and the second is a unary
function that takes a `Request` and return a `Task` of a `Response`.

```js
import Task from "https://deno.land/x/functional@v1.1.0/library/Task.js";
import Response from "https://deno.land/x/functional_io@v0.5.0/library/Response.js";
import startHTTPServer from "./library/server.js";

startHTTPServer({ port: 8080 }, request => Task.of(Response.OK({}, request.raw)));
```

You can test this simple server by executing it your file

```bash
$ deno run --allow-net server.js
```

```bash
$ curl localhost:8080 -d "Hello, Hoge!"
> Hello, Hoge!
```

## Routing

The main routing tool that comes bundled with this library is conveniently called `route`.
It takes a non-zero number of arguments which are defined by a pair of functions.
The first function of the pair is used to assert whether or not to execute the second function.
The assertion function takes a `Request` and return a `Boolean`, the handling function takes a `Request` and
must return a `Task` of a `Response`.

```js
import Task from "https://deno.land/x/functional@v1.1.0/library/Task.js";
import Response from "https://deno.land/x/functional_io@v0.5.0/library/Response.js";
import { route } from "./library/route.js";
import { encodeText } from "./library/utilities.js";

startHTTPServer(
  { port: 8080 },
  route(
    [
      request => request.headers.method === 'GET',
      _ => Task.of(Response.OK({ 'content-type': 'text/plain' }, encodeText("Hello, Hoge!")))
    ]
  );
);
```

### Routing handlers

Because the pattern is common, this library also offers a collection of handler that automatically creates
the assertion function. Each handler takes a `String` or a `RegExp` and a unary function.

```js
import Task from "https://deno.land/x/functional@v1.1.0/library/Task.js";
import Response from "https://deno.land/x/functional_io@v0.5.0/library/Response.js";
import { handlers, route } from "./library/route.js";
import { encodeText } from "./library/utilities.js";

startHTTPServer(
  { port: 8080 },
  route(
    handlers.get('/', _ => Task.of(Response.OK({ 'content-type': 'text/plain' }, encodeText("Hello, Hoge!"))))
  );
);
```

#### Routing with the `explodeRequest` utility

The function `explodeRequest` is a utility that will parse the headers and serialize the body of a `Request`, for
convenience. The function takes two arguments; a binary function that returns a `Task` of `Response` and a `Request`.

The binary function handler will be called with an object containing the original headers, the parsed query string
and other parameters; the second argument is the body of request serialized based on the content type.

```js
import { explodeRequest } from "./library/utilities.js";

startHTTPServer(
  { port: 8080 },
  route(
    handlers.get('/users', explodeRequest(({ filters }) => retrieveUsers(filters))),
    handlers.post(/\/users\/(?<userID>.+)$/, explodeRequest(({ userID }, { data: user }) => updateUser(userID, user)))
  )
);
```

For this sample, a `GET` request made with a query string will be parsed as an object.

```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/users?filters[status]=active
```

And, a `POST` request with a body as JSON will be parsed as well.

```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/users/hoge -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"data\":{\"fullName\":\"Hoge\"}}"
```

 The function `explodeRequest` should cover most use-cases but if you need to create your own parser, check out the
 [`parseRequest`](#parsing-requests) function.

#### Composing routes

Finally, you can compose your routes for increased readability.

```js
const userRoutes = [ handlers.get('/', handleRetrieveUsers), ... ];
const sensorRoutes = [ handlers.get('/', handleRetrieveSensors), ... ];

startHTTPServer({ port: 8080 }, route(...userRoutes, ...sensorRoutes));
```

### Middleware

Before talking about middlewares, I think it is important to talk about the power of function composition and couple of
things special about `startHTTPServer` and `route`:

  1. The function `startHTTPServer` takes a unary function that must return a `Task` of `Response`.
  2. The function `route`, will always return early if the argument is not a `Request`.

So for example, if you needed to discard any request with a content type that is not `application/json`, you could
do the following.

```js
import { compose } from "https://x.nest.land/ramda@0.27.0/source/index.js";

startHTTPServer(
  { port: 8080 },
  compose(
    route(...routes),
    request => request.headers.accept !== 'application/json'
      ? Task.of(Response.BadRequest({}, new Uint8Array([])))
      : request
  )
);
```
